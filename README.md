# Glueckstagebuch

I made this app as the final project during the Android study jam from the Women Techmakers Berlin

**Winner of the WTM Berlin Android Study Jam 2016 Presentations**

This app helps the user to focus on the good stuff what happened during the day by asking 5 questions and display the answers on the screen. Also there is the possibility to save them as a note or send them as an email to friends :D
